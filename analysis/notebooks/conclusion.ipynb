    "1. For each of the 3 test dimensions, the performance of these two drives on each of the 3 platforms is consistent.\n",
    "  - 256GB-55MS101IT9JW @ Rock64_1 = 128GB-75AS1011T9HW @ Rock64_1 *(latency not tested)*\n",
    "  - 256GB-55MS101IT9JW @ Rock64_2 = 128GB-75AS1011T9HW @ Rock64_2\n",
    "  - 256GB-55MS101IT9JW @ HP = 128GB-75AS1011T9HW @ HP\n",
    "1. Platforms comparison:\n",
    "   - **Throughput**: **HP** performs better than the **Rock64** at block size 4KB and 8KB for R/W Mix 100/0 (read) and 0/100 (write) because of the performance limitation of the the BIG core on the Rock64. For all the other block sizes, **Rock64** performs better than the **HP** for both the read and write I/O patterns.\n",
    "   - **IOPS**: For all R/W Mixes, the performance of these two platforms with block sizes of 512B, 4KB and 8KB is not consistent and **HP** achieves **higher** IOPS than **Rock64** platform for these 3 cases. For all the other combinations of block sizes and R/W Mixes, the values of IOPS from these two platforms are consistent. No CPU bottleneck is detected during the IOPS tests.\n",
    "   - **Latency**: For all different block sizes and R/W Mixes, the **Rock64** always has **higher** latency than the **HP**. No CPU bottleneck is detected during the latency tests."
