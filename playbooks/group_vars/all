# (DEBUG OPTION) Changing this option to True will interfere the behaviour of
# `run_wipc_once` in the role vars. In this case, the workload independent
# pre-conditioning (wipc) will totally be skipped if `run_wipc_once` was yes,
# while it will only be skipped the first time if `run_wipc_once` was no.
skip_first_wipc: False

# (DEBUG OPTION) Setting this option to True as well as skip_first_wipc to
# False if you want to run workload independent pre-conditioning (wipc) only.

# One possible usage is to set the CPU affinity by using `taskset -c`
